\section{Authenticated encryption (Age of Ultron)}
Last time we proved CPA-security of $\Pi$. Today we will explore the
\textit{auth}  property.
Consider $\Pi$ as
    \begin{gather*}
        Enc:\{0,1\}^{\lambda}*\M \to \C \\
        Tag:\{0,1\}^{\lambda}*\C \to \Phi 
    \end{gather*}
   
    \begin{lemma}
        If $Tag(.,.)$ is \textbf{EUF-CMA} , then $\Pi$ has
    auth-property. 
    \end{lemma}
    
    What is \textbf{EUF-CMA} ?\\ 
    It's a property similar to \textbf{uf-cma} ,
    but now I want that the challenge message $(m^{*}, \phi^{*})$ is made by a
    fresh $m^{*}$ and a valid \textbf{fresh} $\phi^{*}$.\\ 
    The difference is that in ufcma we didn't care about the freshness of
    $\phi^{*}$.

\begin{proof}
    Suppose $\Pi$ has not the \textit{auth}  property.\\ 
    So we have an $\A'$ which can win the \textbf{auth} challenge of $\Pi$.\\
    On the other hand, we have a $\Pi_{2}$ schema which uses an \textbf{euf-cma}
    $Tag(.,.)$ function.\\
    So, by reduction, we show that ...






\end{proof}
